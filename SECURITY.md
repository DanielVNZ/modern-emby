# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it privately so we can fix it before public disclosure.

Preferred options:

1. Open a GitHub issue and label it **security** (if you are comfortable with public disclosure).
2. Contact the maintainers directly for sensitive reports.

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and provide an update once the issue is validated.

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied to the latest version on the main branch.
